## Contents
this is literally just practice for C++.  
i'm getting most of my stuff off of [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/).  
most likely a lot of the code here is gonna be bad but am tryna fix it allow it.  

## Contributing
literally why would you contribute to this there is no reason to do it go away.  

## Issues and Pull Requests
yeah no.

## Cloning
so first you need Git (why would you not have Git if you're using GitHub).  
then pop up a terminal of your choice and navigate to the folder you want it to be in.  
then just run:  
`git clone https://github.com/IonicArgon/cpp_practice.git`  
why do you even care anyways this is a private repository  

## Building
just realized that the Makefile isn't gonna be cross-platform compatible.  
it's not like it matters this is a private repo lol.  
maybe i'll learn how to use cmake later so i can make it cross-platform compatible and learn something too.
